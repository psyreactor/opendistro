# Client Api

The Opendistro gem attempts to make the Opendistro API as object-oriented and Ruby-like as possible. All of the methods and API calls are heavily documented with examples inline using YARD. 
In order to keep the examples versioned with the code, this documentation only lists a few examples for using the Opendistro gem. Please see the inline documentation for the full API documentation
